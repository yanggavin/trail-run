# TrailRun Beta Testing Guide

This guide covers how to set up and manage beta testing for TrailRun before releasing to the App Store and Google Play Store.

## üéØ Beta Testing Strategy

### Testing Phases
1. **Internal Testing** (Team & Close Friends) - 1-2 weeks
2. **Closed Beta** (Invited Trail Runners) - 2-3 weeks  
3. **Open Beta** (Public TestFlight/Play Console) - 1-2 weeks
4. **Release Candidate** (Final validation) - 1 week

### Target Beta Testers
- **Trail runners** of different experience levels
- **Different device types** (iPhone, Android, various models)
- **Geographic diversity** (urban, rural, mountain, forest environments)
- **Usage patterns** (casual joggers to ultra-marathon runners)

## üì± iOS Beta Testing (TestFlight)

### Step 1: Set Up TestFlight

1. **Build for TestFlight**
   ```bash
   # Build preview version for testing
   eas build --platform ios --profile preview
   ```

2. **Submit to TestFlight**
   ```bash
   # Submit to TestFlight (not App Store)
   eas submit --platform ios --latest --non-interactive
   ```

3. **Configure TestFlight in App Store Connect**
   - Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   - Select your app ‚Üí TestFlight tab
   - Add build information and testing notes

### Step 2: Internal Testing (Team)

1. **Add Internal Testers**
   - Add team members by Apple ID
